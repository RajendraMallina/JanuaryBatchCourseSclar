/* Procedure to solve this problem in linear time.
 * 
 * The total amount of water you can store on a each building was the min(leftMaxBuilding, rightMaxBuilding)
 * So we need to keep two variables which describes the left most height for and right most height for building.
 * So start program execution from both ends(left and right). If right side building height was greater than left
 * side building than calculate water content from the left side. If your left side building is left side max height
 * building than water content on this building was 0. Otherwise water content on your building was max height of 
 * left side building - current building height than increase move to next building again compare with the right side building.
 * If right side building height is less than your current building than do the above operation on right side.
 * Repeat the same operation until before your left side building and right side building meet each other.
 * That means when you reach middle building.
